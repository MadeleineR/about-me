                <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    I started working at willhaben in September 2016 after finishing my master studies. 
                    Since then i worked on various projects, mainly for the jobs area 
                    (<a href="www.willhaben.at/jobs">www.willhaben.at/jobs</a>). 
                    The implementation of the responsive design of the jobs platform was the first project 
                    i worked on. Then we started to rework the purchase process for self service customers, 
                    where we could achieve a significant raise in bookings and turnover. Another big 
                    milestone, where i had the change to contribute, was the implementation of the single 
                    sign-on solution for the entire willhaben platform. My last big project, where i was 
                    responsible also for managing the project as a technical project lead, was the migration 
                    of the matching provider. The aim of this project was improving both the job advert 
                    import process (job parsing) and the job search.

                    Besides the above mentioned projects, i help our jobs support team whenever they 
                    have to deal with a customer or user problem, where they need specific technical 
                    support. Furthermore, for guaranteeing 24/7 uptime of the jobs platform, i'm 
                    participating in on-call duties.

                <h3>Junior Web Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    After finishing my bachelor studies, i had the change to work for epiframe and 
                    gaining my first experience as a software developer. Throughout the two years,
                    i worked on different web and app projects. Implementing a responsive design 
                    for the various job plattforms we maintained, was one of them. I also worked on
                    extending customer backends for managing the site content or the integration of 
                    customer APIs for data imports.
